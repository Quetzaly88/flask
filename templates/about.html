    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
        came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
        decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
        also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
        superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
        business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth,
                Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in
                exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA
                2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his
                shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield,"
                which remained with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <p>
            Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
            accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
            A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
            advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

         <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.[3]

          <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
            although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere
            between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years,"
            and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA
            2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the
            Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.
